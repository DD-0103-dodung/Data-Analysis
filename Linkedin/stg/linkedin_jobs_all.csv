data engineer,Analytics Engineer (Junior to Mid Level),Holistics Data,Vietnam,3 months ago,https://vn.linkedin.com/jobs/view/analytics-engineer-junior-to-mid-level-at-holistics-data-4301987191?position=4&pageNum=0&refId=AMJ0F8J%2BzGR1%2FCfAvzKJ4A%3D%3D&trackingId=%2FW2sKuD7135nlQrMZDlR1w%3D%3D,"Introduction Holistics is a Business Intelligence platform built for the AI era. We are the team behind projects like the BI tool Holistics, the database diagram tool dbdiagram.io, and the open-source project dbml.org. We help data teams build a trusted, supervised self-service analytics experience for their business stakeholders. We are searching for an Analytics Engineer (junior to mid-level) to help us evolve our data pipeline to support internal decisions, as well as helping our customers get more value of Holistics BI platform. This is a full-time role based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam , with a flexible, hybrid WFH/WFO setup. ‍ What You Will Do This role is a hybrid of technical analytics work and customer-facing engagements. Your time will be allocated across two core functions. Internal data pipeline/modeling & BI: You will actively contribute to our internal data & BI platform, ensuring our internal stakeholders get the data they need Manage and enhance internal data pipeline: Contribute to the maintenance of our internal data ingestion, transformation, and reporting pipeline, ensuring data is timely and correct. This hands-on work will be a source of direct feedback for our product team. Build best-practice data models: Develop and refactor internal data models using dbt, following data modeling paradigms like Kimball/Inmon and star/snowflake schemas. These models will serve as real-world examples for customer education. Ensure data quality and integrity: Implement data tests and validation checks to ensure internal metrics are calculated correctly, translating these practices into customer-facing guidance. Research and experiment with new tools: Test-drive emerging BI and analytics engineering tools, evaluate how they might enhance our demos or internal stack, and share your findings with the product and marketing teams. Customer engagement: Besides working on internal data pipeline, you’ll also get the chance to engage with our customers directly on their analytics projects Guide customer onboarding: Work directly with new customers via shared Slack channels, review their data warehouse schemas, and coach them on data modeling best practices Develop enablement assets: Convert modeling best practices and hard-won insights into step-by-step guides, sample Git repositories, and short video tutorials so customers and internal teams can self-serve. Deliver scoped consulting: Spend focused time helping strategic accounts solve complex data modeling challenges, then document the patterns for future projects and content. Our current data setup About We wrote an entire book explaining the complex analytics landscape, so it’s fair to say that we know a thing or two about setting up data stack. Our data setup is as follows: Ingestion and Transformation: Event tracking (Snowplow) and ETLs from various data sources into our data lake (GCS) and data warehouse (BigQuery). The data is then transformed and moved to the data mart using dbt. Serving: Reporting is served on Holistics, and reverse-ETLs are handled to push data back into our CRMs for operational purposes. Orchestration: We use Prefect on top of the data stack to orchestrate and automate data pipelines and other operations. On the business side, we practice what we preach. That means instead of building reports and dashboards, Data team works to maintain a common set of metric definitions and educate the business users on how to self-serve the platform effectively. ‍ What We Look For In You We are seeking a candidate with a unique blend of technical depth and communication skills. Mindset A genuine interest in the data analytics / BI industry as a whole and a love for owning the entire data stack, not just one part of it. Systems thinking: You can reason about how business operations, data collection, and system architecture interact and affect one another. When you solve a problem once, you instinctively template it for the next fifty times. Excellent communication skills: You can communicate complex technical ideas clearly in both written and spoken English. You write like you code - clear, concise, and maintainable. Problem-solving orientation: You have solid problem decomposition skills and are energized by live problem-solving in workshops and discovery calls. Continuous learner: You possess a growth mindset and are excited to learn something new as part of your work every day. Technical Skills SQL: You have a good foundation in SQL. You can write readable queries to extract and manipulate data, and you can explain core concepts like grain and joins. Data Modeling: You are familiar with fundamental data modeling concepts (e.g., dimensional modeling) and schema designs (star/snowflake) and understand why we transform raw data into user-friendly formats. Programming: You have some experience with Python or an equivalent language for scripting and data manipulation tasks. Version Control: You are familiar with the basics of Git for tracking changes and collaborating on projects. Cloud Databases: You have exposure to, or academic experience with, a major cloud data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift). Nice-to-haves: Exposure to dbt, Looker/LookML, Holistics, or other modern BI tools; a demonstrated interest in learning how data infrastructure empowers business decisions. ‍ Interview Process Round 1: A chat with the team and a light technical interview to discuss your skills, experience, and past projects.‍ Round 2: A short take-home assignment or on-site assignment to assess your technical and problem-solving skills.‍ Round 3: A culture and behavioral chat with management. ‍ Why You'll Love Working 💕 Benefits Flexible working arrangement, hybrid work (WFO+WFH) policies 14 annual leaves, 14 sick leaves, and childcare leave policy. Annual budget for personal and professional growth, well-being, and interest cultivations. 24/7 healthcare insurance; periodic medical checkups. 13-month salary; annual compensation reviews Weekly happy hours, company-organized events. 🏢 Workstations provided for maximum productivity MacBook (or Laptop) Grant Mechanical Keyboard + Mouse Big-screen monitor(s) 🌐 Working time: From Monday – Friday, from 9.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. 🌐 Work location: 457-459 Nguyen Dinh Chieu, Ward 5, District 3, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
